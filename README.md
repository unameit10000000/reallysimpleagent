This is an extremely basic and minimal ***command line interface (CLI)*** **AI Agent** built using the **Anthropic API** to perform tasks.

## üíª | Example Output 

What the Basic CLI output looks like:

## üî§ | About
Currently the tracking of cryptocurrency prices is supported, however there are placeholders for fetching weather, performing calculations and providing Wikipedia search results, both which have yet to be implemented. (feel free to fork and submit a PR) Furthermore the Agent CLI provides a interactive chat, similar to ChatGPT and different language models are supported. (Haiku, Sonnet). Additionally, the agent now uses AI-driven command interpretation instead of keyword matching, making it a bit more 'intelligent'.

## üåü | Features and Actions 
- **Interactive CLI**: Engage with the assistant through simple text prompts.
- **Colorful Output**: Responses are formatted with color using the `colorama` library.
- **Multiple Models**: Supports models from the Anthropic API (like Haiku and Sonnet).
- **Dynamic User Input**: Accepts user queries and responds accordingly.
- **Cryptocurrency Price Tracking**: Automated price tracking for crypto.
- **Scheduled Tasks**: Background task scheduling for continuous price monitoring.

### Action Support (Placeholders)
The assistant currently has placeholders for actions such as:
- Searching Wikipedia üìö
- Performing calculations ‚ûó
- Fetching weather updates üå§Ô∏è
